## [Unreleased]

### Added

* CDNOTS algorithm — constraint-based causal discovery with nonstationarity-based orientation
* CDNOTS+ algorithm — PCMCI+-style two-phase skeleton for improved precision on dense graphs
* CEDAR algorithm — scalable pairwise discovery with automatic lag selection
* GRACE algorithm — hybrid neural gates with L0 regularization for high-dimensional settings
* 8 GPU-accelerated conditional independence tests (KCI, SplitKCI, DFCIT, SigKCI, RCOT, ParCorr, CMIknn, GCMI) plus StratifiedCIT and CMIknnMixedGPU for mixed data
* CLI (`causal-ts`) with `discover`, `generate`, `evaluate`, and `plot` commands
